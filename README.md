# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:

### Step1 : 

Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

### Step 2: 

Prepare the lists from each equations and assign in np.array()

### Step 3: 

Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the inverse of the given matrix

### Step 4: 

End the program

## Program:
